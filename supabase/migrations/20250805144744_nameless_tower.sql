  # Fix RLS policies for username-based authentication

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policies to work with username-based user_id instead of auth.uid()
    - Allow authenticated and anonymous users to manage their own data based on user_id
    - Maintain data isolation between different usernames

  2. Tables Updated
    - user_settings: Allow insert/update/select based on user_id matching
    - transactions: Update policies for username-based access
    - budgets: Update policies for username-based access  
    - savings_goals: Update policies for username-based access
